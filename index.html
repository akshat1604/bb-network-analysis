                     <h1 style="color: #026635;">Dataset:</h1>
                     <p>
                        I wanted data, namely information about Breaking Bad that I could evaluate, to get my analysis off to a good start. Unfortunately, I couldn't find an existing dataset that suited my requirements. I decided to utilize web scraping to obtain the necessary information straight from the <a href="https://breakingbad.fandom.com/">Breaking Bad Fandom</a> website. I crawled through the website, extracting characters from all the episodes, and season summaries using <a href="https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/">BeautifulSoup.</a> Although the fandom website is a treasure trove of information, it was difficult for me to find what I needed by browsing through its pages. 
                        One of the challenges I encountered was dealing with the final season, which was split into two parts. I made sure to scrape data from both halves to capture the full picture of the series' conclusion. After some HTML parsing and web crawling, I managed to gather a neat dataset containing all the crucial details I needed for my analysis, namely, all the character names and the textual season summaries. In a nutshell, my dataset may not have come from a fancy source, but it's packed with the information I need to delve into the world of Breaking Bad.

                     <h1 style="color: #026635;">Techniques & Terminologies:</h1>
                     <p>
                        When working on network analysis, I've employed a range of techniques and concepts that may seem daunting at first glance. However, by breaking down these terms into simpler explanations, even those unfamiliar with computer science can grasp their significance:
<br>
<span style="font-size: 25px; color: #026635;"><b>Named Entity Recognition (NER):</b></span> <br> Named Entity Recognition is a technique used to identify and classify entities within text data. In the context of Breaking Bad, NER helps us extract specific information such as character names, locations, and organizations mentioned in episode summaries or character descriptions. <br>

<span style="font-size: 25px; color: #026635;"><b>Centrality Measures:</b></span> <br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Network Centrality:</b></span> Network centrality refers to the importance of a node (or character in our case) within a network. It quantifies how central or influential a character is in the overall structure of the Breaking Bad universe.<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Degree Centrality:</b></span>  Degree centrality measures how well-connected a character is by counting the number of connections (or edges) they have with other characters. A character with high degree centrality is highly connected and may play a significant role in the narrative.<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Betweenness Centrality:</b></span> Betweenness centrality identifies characters that act as bridges or intermediaries between other characters in the network. These characters often control the flow of information or influence within the Breaking Bad universe.<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Closeness Centrality:</b></span> Closeness centrality measures how quickly a character can reach all other characters in the network. Characters with high closeness centrality are central to the network's communication and interaction dynamics.<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Eigen Centrality:</b></span>  Eigen centrality evaluates a character's importance based on their connections to other important characters. It takes into account not only a character's direct connections but also the connections of their connections.<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>PageRank:</b></span> PageRank, originally developed by Google, assesses the importance of a character based on the quality and quantity of their connections. Characters with high PageRank are considered influential within the network.
<br>
These terminologies served as essential tools in my analysis, enabling me to quantify and understand the roles and relationships of characters within the Breaking Bad universe. Through their application, I gained valuable insights into the dynamics that drive the narrative and shape the interconnected web of characters in the series.

                     </p>
                     <h1 style="color: #026635;">Analysis:</h1>
                     <p>
                        In my effort to analyze the intricate narrative threads of Breaking Bad, I utilized data exploration and analysis, leveraging advanced techniques to uncover the underlying dynamics of character relationships within the series. Let's delve into the key methodologies employed and the insights gained through my analysis.
<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Data Preparation:</b></span>
My analysis began with the application of Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the Spacy library. By parsing through the text summaries scraped from each season, I identified and extracted entities such as character names, laying the groundwork for our subsequent analysis. Once the entities were identified by NER, I filtered out only the entities which are also in my list of characters in the show. This was done in order to only focus on the relevant information.  
<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Relationship Generation using Sliding Window Technique:</b></span>

Imagine we're looking at a sequence of events (in our case, the text summaries) in Breaking Bad, where different characters appear one after the other. To understand how they interact, we use something called a sliding window. A sliding window in this scenario would be the x number of lines in the season summaries. 
Let's say we're focusing on a group of 5 lines at a time. Now, if we see the same character appearing twice in a row, we skip it. This helps us avoid repeating things we already know. Then, we make a list of all the unique characters we've seen.

Now, we go through this unique list and look at each pair of characters one after the other. For example, if we see Walter followed by Jesse, we note down that Walter and Jesse have some kind of connection. Then, we move on to the next pair, like Jesse and Walter. We keep doing this until we've looked at all the pairs.

This process helps us understand how characters are linked to each other in the story. It's like connecting the dots between different characters, helping us see who interacts with whom and how often.
<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Graph Construction and Centrality Measures:</b></span>
From the relationships generated, I constructed network graphs for each season and for the series as a whole. Each relationship was assigned a weight based on the frequency of occurrence, capturing the strength of interaction between characters. Utilizing the NetworkX library, we then calculated a range of centrality measures, including Network Centrality, Degree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, Closeness Centrality, and Eigen Centrality. These measures offered valuable insights into the relative importance of characters within the Breaking Bad universe, illuminating the central figures and their roles.Figure 1 depicts the most important characters in the show.

<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635; width: 100%;"><b>Community Detection and Character Importance:</b></span>
By analyzing the network graphs and centrality measures, I identified distinct communities within each season and across the entire series. These communities represent clusters of characters with strong interconnections, highlighting the dynamics of relationships within Breaking Bad. Furthermore, my analysis revealed the leader or most important character within each community, shedding light on the hierarchy of influence and power dynamics at play.
