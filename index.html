                     <p>
                        When working on network analysis, I've employed a range of techniques and concepts that may seem daunting at first glance. However, by breaking down these terms into simpler explanations, even those unfamiliar with computer science can grasp their significance:
<br>
<span style="font-size: 25px; color: #026635;"><b>Named Entity Recognition (NER):</b></span> <br> Named Entity Recognition is a technique used to identify and classify entities within text data. In the context of Breaking Bad, NER helps us extract specific information such as character names, locations, and organizations mentioned in episode summaries or character descriptions. <br>
<span style="font-size: 25px; color: #026635;"><b>Centrality Measures:</b></span> <br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Network Centrality:</b></span> Network centrality refers to the importance of a node (or character in our case) within a network. It quantifies how central or influential a character is in the overall structure of the Breaking Bad universe.<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Degree Centrality:</b></span>  Degree centrality measures how well-connected a character is by counting the number of connections (or edges) they have with other characters. A character with high degree centrality is highly connected and may play a significant role in the narrative.<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Betweenness Centrality:</b></span> Betweenness centrality identifies characters that act as bridges or intermediaries between other characters in the network. These characters often control the flow of information or influence within the Breaking Bad universe.<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Closeness Centrality:</b></span> Closeness centrality measures how quickly a character can reach all other characters in the network. Characters with high closeness centrality are central to the network's communication and interaction dynamics.<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>Eigen Centrality:</b></span>  Eigen centrality evaluates a character's importance based on their connections to other important characters. It takes into account not only a character's direct connections but also the connections of their connections.<br>
<span style="font-size: 20px; color: #026635;"><b>PageRank:</b></span> PageRank, originally developed by Google, assesses the importance of a character based on the quality and quantity of their connections. Characters with high PageRank are considered influential within the network.
